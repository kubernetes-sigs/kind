[kind] is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes".  
kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

If you have [go] 1.17+ and [docker], [podman] or [nerdctl] installed `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@{{< stableVersion >}} && kind create cluster` is all you need!

<img src="images/kind-create-cluster.png" />

kind consists of:

- Go [packages][packages] implementing [cluster creation][cluster package], [image build][build package], etc.
- A command line interface ([`kind`][kind cli]) built on these packages.
- Docker [image(s)][images] written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc.
- [`kubetest`][kubetest] integration also built on these packages (WIP)

kind bootstraps each "node" with [kubeadm][kubeadm]. For more details see [the design documentation][design doc].

**NOTE**: kind is still a work in progress, see the [1.0 roadmap].

## Installation and usage

For more detailed instructions see [the user guide][user guide].

You can install kind with `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@{{< stableVersion>}}` (for [go] [1.17+][go-supported]). This will put `kind` in
`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. You may need to add that directory to your `$PATH` as
shown [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) if you encounter the error
`kind: command not found` after installation.

To use kind, you will also need to [install docker].  
Once you have docker running you can create a cluster with:

{{< codeFromInline lang="bash" >}}
kind create cluster
{{< /codeFromInline >}}

To delete your cluster use:

{{< codeFromInline lang="bash" >}}
kind delete cluster
{{< /codeFromInline >}}

<!--TODO(bentheelder): improve this part of the guide-->
To create a cluster from Kubernetes source:

- ensure that Kubernetes is cloned in `$(go env GOPATH)/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`
- build a node image and create a cluster with 

{{< codeFromInline lang="bash" >}}
kind build node-image
kind create cluster --image kindest/node:latest
{{< /codeFromInline >}}

Multi-node clusters and other advanced features may be configured with a config
file, for more usage see [the user guide][user guide] or run `kind [command] --help`
