**What happened**:

<!-- If creating a cluster failed, please run the create cluster command again with the `--retain` flag to prevent cleanup on failure, then run `kind export logs` to dump the cluster logs before cleaning up manually with `kind delete cluster`. Then attach the logs from the path printed by `kind export logs` to this issue as a zip or tarball archive. This will aid us greatly in diagnosing the failure. When `kubeadm init` / `kubeadm join` fail, there are many possible cases and the kubeadm logs typically don't contain enough details vs the full cluster logs. Thanks!-->
